# App
An iOS app I made for Swift class.

Even though it says Meme Maker, this is how the code works. I tried doing the project from scratch, but it would always run into errors.
I tried to change the name of the folders, and x code didn't like that at all, so it is still called Meme Maker.
It is actually a pc build part suggestion app, in particular for the people that don't know jack about computers,
and the people who are either getting into computers or are already into computers and don't really have the time to look up
parts for a new computer, but want one.
